These modifications primarily focus on improving steady-state phase responses and membrane trafficking efficiency, crucial for its performance under continuous or high-frequency repetitive light pulses.

1. **Steady-State Phase Response and Photocurrent**: ChIEF is designed to maintain increased steady-state phase responses without reducing peak photocurrent, which is essential for applications requiring consistent photocurrent responses under repetitive stimulation (Lin2012Optogenetic pages 13-15; Lin2010A pages 6-6).

2. **Light Sensitivity and Recovery**: Although ChIEF has slightly reduced light sensitivity compared to ChR2, it compensates with greater steady-state responses. It does not fully recover in the dark, but recovery can be induced by 570 nm light, suggesting a specific mutation affecting its light response and recovery dynamics (Lin2010A pages 6-6).

3. **Expression and Membrane Trafficking**: ChIEF expresses more highly than ChR2 in mammalian cells and efficiently traffics to the membrane. This characteristic is likely due to genetic modifications that enhance its expression and localization, reducing potential toxicity at high expression levels (Lin2010A pages 6-6; Lin2012Optogenetic pages 13-15).

1. **R159 and D292** in CrChR-1: These residues are crucial for pH recovery and ion transport function, as observed in experiments with truncated variants of ChR-1 expressed in E. coli (Doi2015Structural pages 11-13).

2. **E130Q and D196N** in ReaChR: E130Q mutation leads to a preactive conformation by altering the orientation of Gln130, affecting ion selectivity and accelerating M-state formation. D196N neutralizes a negative charge near the chromophore, impairing the syn/anti reaction of retinal, which influences the stability of the retinal-binding pocket and overall protein stability (Kaufmann2017Proton pages 8-9).

3. **G220S, F228Y, and S295A** in the C1C2 chimera: These mutations replace Gly220, Phe228, and Ser295 with Ser, Tyr, and Ala respectively, as found in VChR1. The mutation S295A shows a significant change in electrostatic contribution (3.23 kcal/mol), indicating its importance in spectral differences between the C1C2 chimera and VChR1 (Kamiya2013Structural pages 4-4).

4. **E162A and D292A** in C1C2: D292A almost completely lost channel activity and altered the time required to open the channel, highlighting the importance of Asp292 as a major proton acceptor (Kato2015StructureFunctional pages 7-9).

These mutations significantly alter the functional characteristics of ChR1, impacting ion conductance, selectivity, and the overall stability of the protein.","VcChR1, VcChR2"
E154A,"This mutation accelerates the kinetics of CheRiff, shifts its action spectrum peak to λmax = 460 nm, and reduces the likelihood of unintended activation by red light. This enhances the sensitivity and response time of CheRiff in triggering action potentials with lower light intensity and higher precision.",Hochbaum2014Alloptical pages 6-8,more beneficial,46c78034-1b28-4e47-9bad-ff078cd034ed,What are the mutations or variants of CheRiff that influence its functional characteristics?,"The CheRiff optogenetic actuator has undergone specific mutations to enhance its functional characteristics. A notable mutation is E154A, which not only accelerated the kinetics of CheRiff but also shifted its action spectrum peak to λmax = 460 nm. This shift is crucial as it reduces the likelihood of unintended activation by red light, thereby improving the sensitivity and response time of CheRiff in triggering action potentials with lower light intensity and higher precision (Hochbaum2014Alloptical pages 6-8).

Further analysis and engineering of CheRiff and other channelrhodopsin variants have been guided by machine learning models. These models have been used to predict and analyze the functional properties of various CheRiff variants, although specific mutations beyond E154A in these variants are not detailed in the provided excerpts. The studies involved creating libraries of channelrhodopsin variants, including CheRiff, and selecting those with optimized properties such as photocurrent strength and wavelength sensitivity (Bedbrook2019Machine pages 6-8; Bedbrook2019Machine pages 3-5).

In summary, the E154A mutation is explicitly identified as a significant modification in CheRiff that enhances its optogenetic utility by improving kinetics and spectral response (Hochbaum2014Alloptical pages 6-8). Other variants and mutations are implied to exist and have been studied through machine learning approaches, but specific details on these are not provided in the context given.",Acetabularia rhodopsin II
